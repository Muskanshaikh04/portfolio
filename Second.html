      There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
      majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
      randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
      going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
      anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
      generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
      making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary
      of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
      structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated
      Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
      non-characteristic words etc.

      Kashmir (/ˈkæʃmɪər/ KASH-meer or /kæʃˈmɪər/ kash-MEER) is the northernmost
      geographical region of the Indian subcontinent. Until the mid-19th
      century, the term Kashmir denoted only the Kashmir Valley between the
      Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range. The term has since also come to
      encompass a larger area that includes the Indian-administered territories
      of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, the Pakistani-administered territories of
      Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Chinese-administered
      territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.[1][2][3] The
      Lidder river valley near Pahalgam Nanga Parbat in Kashmir, the
      ninth-highest mountain on Earth, is the western anchor of the Himalayas In
      1820, the Sikh Empire, under Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir.[4] In 1846,
      after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, and upon the purchase
      of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of
      Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Kashmir. The rule of his
      descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage)[5][6] of the British
      Crown, lasted until the Partition of India in 1947, when the former
      princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed territory,
      now administered by three countries: China, India, and
      Pakistan.[1][7][8][2]
